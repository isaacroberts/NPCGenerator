NPCGenerator allows DMs to quickly generate interesting characters during Dungeons and Dragons games. DMs can create lists of names and traits, character templates, and categories before the session to ensure consistency and to give the DM something to do between sessions. 

The system uses ASCII formatting to allow linking and switching. For example: "[English Male Name | English Female Name] the [Weapon]" could generate such legends as "Henrietta the Greatsword" or "Joseph the Mace". 

I ran a campaign that used this app to randomly generate characters, spells, and minor dieties, to great hilarity.
