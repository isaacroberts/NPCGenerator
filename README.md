# NPCGenerator
This is a tool I wrote to help me DM roleplaying games. Oftentimes, players will go to new areas and talk to characters that you haven't planned out, and you need to be able to create interesting characters on the fly. This is a tool to randomly generate characters so that I don't have to name every character "Pencil McTableson" or "Bob #26"
