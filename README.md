# NPCGenerator
This is a tool for GMing roleplaying games. (In roleplaying games, one person creates a world and a plot and other players play characters that go on epic adventures in that world. Think Lord of the Rings, but with friends. GM stands for "Game Master", which is the player creating the world.)

NPCGenerator randomly generates interesting characters for DMs that have trouble coming up with filler details on the fly. Character templates draw from GM-created lists and can mix lists or recursively call on other lists. 

For example: Hero Name={[English Male Name | English Female Name] the [Weapon] | [Animal]{breaker|helper|blessed} | Bob} could generate such legends as "Henrietta the Greatsword" or "Lionbreaker" or "Bob". 

It's designed to be mildly user friendly but users will need to read the instructions to understand what they're looking at.

This is my most recent project, and has the cleanest code, if not the most efficient.
